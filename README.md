# Mansoura Robotics Website ü§ñ

This Website is mainly meant to be an introduction to anyone interested in our team and wants to know exactly who we are
It's divided into 5 main sections: Home - About Us - Team - Hackathon - Contact Us

1- Home (https://mansourarobotics.onrender.com/): Just like the name suggests, it's the homepage of our website, which can also be seen as a kind of landing page to our Facebook page ( The Learn More button takes the user to our FB page ).
